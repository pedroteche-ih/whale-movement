# Analyzing Bowhead Whale movement in Foxe Basin using

The **Baleana mysticetus**, commonly referred to as the *Bowhead whale*, is a species of whale that is indigenous to arctic and subarctic regions. It is believed to hold the distinction of being the mammal with the **longest lifespan** on Earth, with individuals living for over 200 years. With a length of up to **20 meters** and a weight of up to **100 tons**, the Bowhead whale is the **largest animal** in the Arctic.

This species is classified as a **baleen whale**, utilizing a **filter-feeding system** to feed on plankton and small fish. Additionally, the Bowhead whale is a **migratory species**, annually traveling from the Arctic to the subarctic regions and vice versa.

Unfortunately, the Bowhead whale is currently an **endangered species**, with a population of only **10,000 individuals**.

The **Foxe Basin** is a shallow oceanic basin located in the eastern Canadian Arctic, bounded by the *Melville Peninsula* to the east and the *Baffin Island* to the west. It is connected to the Hudson Bay through the *Hudson Strait*, and to the Labrador Sea through the *Fury and Hecla Strait*.

The basin has a diverse ecosystem that includes various **marine mammals**, such as *polar bears*, *narwhals*, and *beluga whales*, as well as several species of fish and seabirds. The Foxe Basin is also an important area for **Inuit communities**, who rely on its natural resources for their subsistence and cultural practices.

- **Location**: eastern Canadian Arctic
- **Boundaries**: Melville Peninsula (east), Baffin Island (west)
- **Connections**: Hudson Bay (through Hudson Strait), Labrador Sea (through Fury and Hecla Strait and the Gulf of Boothia)
- **Ecosystem**: diverse, including marine mammals (polar bears, narwhals, beluga whales, bowhead whales), fish, and seabirds
- **Importance**: critical to Inuit communities for subsistence and cultural practices.
